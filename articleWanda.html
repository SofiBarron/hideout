                andaVision, the very first series from the MCU has finally come to an end. And so, we review a bit of
                the plot, what we loved best, what we thought of the message it left us, and what we may expect moving
                forward.
            </p>

            <p class="articleParagraph">
                Keep in mind this article contains spoilers from the first season of WandaVision!
            </p>

            <p class="articleParagraph">
                In contrast to any other MCU movie or show so far, we start WandaVision with a black and white episode.
                It does not, at first, pack the same action punch we may be used to from the movies. Instead, we’re
                offered a sitcom from two of Marvel’s most powerful characters. While it may seem an off start, it pays
                off in the long run. As each episode takes on a different sitcom tribute, it does also start mixing up
                with what may be going on. And that’s one of the main charms of the show: Wanda recreates a life based
                on what she used to watch as a kid, a life where everything is safe, where the possibility of a marriage
                and a family is real.
            </p>

            <p class="articleParagraph">
                But all good things must come to an end. With the reality of what’s going on in Westview uncovered by
                one very perceptive Vision and some clear messages from the outside, the world starts crumbling.
                However, it’s not all Wanda’s fault exactly. Inside the grand reality the Scarlet Witch has created,
                there’s another witch, one that has had a play at each corner to obtain Wanda’s power. A character we
                would not have thought of at first, unless we’ve read House of M. Of course, we’re referring to Agatha
                Harkness. In a way, it’s Agatha who makes Wanda confront her lie: Vision is dead, her kids are not real,
                and the world she “created” has compromised the lives of so many along the way.
            </p>

                <img class="col-sm-4" src="images/ori.gif" alt="Naru rescuing Ori">
            </div>

            <p class="articleParagraph">
                While the witches face off, there’s another fight going on with the two Visions. The one created by
                SWORD to put a stop to Wanda’s creation. The encounter of these two synthetic humanoids is resolved in
                the most unexpected of ways, through the paradox of Theseus Ship. In an overly simplistic way, the
                paradox begs the following question: If something or someone stops having the same pieces that made up
                its existence at a specific point in time, is it still the same something or someone? This line of
                questioning is what also explains in a way what may be Vision’s identity.
            </p>

            <p class="articleParagraph">
                In the end, Wanda manages to beat Agatha by releasing her power. She became the actual Scarlet Witch,
                the most powerful mutant of all, and one who was interfered with and harmed the daily life of people who
                were just bystanders, the opposite of what is expected of a hero. In truth, Wanda feels horrible, but
                what may be seen through her self-discovery is the five stages of grief. Denial, anger, bargaining,
                depression, and acceptance can all be pinpointed throughout WandaVision. And it’s that build-up that
                makes the story so much more than simply a nice tribute to sitcoms, or just the first MCU tv show.

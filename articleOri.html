                t is not always easy to choose what to read next when you are going through a slump. So is true for
                games. However, there is also one other common denominator, and that is how we tend to gravitate to
                other titles. And that is exactly what happened with Ori and The Blind Forest.
            </p>

            <p class="articleParagraph">
                This game has been around for a while. It is a well-known indie by Moon Studios that was first published
                for Windows and was later on adapted for other platforms. It was because of that last fact that I found
                it on the Nintendo Switch store and just purchased it without a second thought. It was cheap, so why
                not? Then again, I was not at all prepared for what was awaiting me.
            </p>

            <p class="articleParagraph">
                Firstly, the storyline. If you thought this would be a bit of a mindless platform title like Crash
                Bandicoot where wholesomeness and fun are ever-present, I must tell you now, it is not. The plot of Ori
                and The Blind Forest leaves behind the humour for sadness as it presents us with a journey to find Ori’s
                family. Of understanding the hurt that has been brought about to the world. And, finally, trying to find
                the balance.
            </p>

            <p class="articleParagraph">
                Secondly, the gameplay. Like any other from the same genre, the purpose is clear, you jump around from
                one place to the other while facing off some obstacles along the way. Simple, right? Not quite. The
                difficulty of the game makes it a play of patience against frustration. Something that may be recalled
                by players of the first Mario Bros. where patterns had to be learnt in order to advance. While it is not
                easy to go through it, it is certainly rewarding to master each ability along the way.
            </p>

            <p class="articleParagraph">
                Thirdly, the music. Ori and The Blind Forest can be recognized simply by the tunes that accompany each
                moment. This may be true for many titles, but what elevates Ori is how connected the melodies feel to
                the story, to the moment. As we need to retry a specific sequence over and over, the music rings in our
                ears, encouraging us. It is a compliment that makes this indie memorable like few others.
            </p>

            <p class="articleParagraph">
                To sum up, Ori and The Blind Forest has been the one title to break up my gaming slump. It offers an
                endearing storyline that sets the player into a quest for balance as well as understanding in a world
                hardly similar to our own. Besides, it grants challenging gameplay, one that mixes a bit of frustration
                with reward. And, finally, an enchanting soundtrack, that accompanies us through each step of our
                adventure.
